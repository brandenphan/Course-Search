Students conduct a correlation-based meta-analysis to help them concretely understand sampling distributions and the difficulties associated with obtaining study results that replicate. This meta-analytic foundation is then leveraged to teach traditional psychological analysis techniques (e.g., t-test, analysis of variance, and bi-variate/multiple regression) with an emphasis on maximizing factors that increase the probability of study findings that replicate. The value of interpreting results using effect sizes with confidence intervals is discussed and the logic of null-hypothesis testing is briefly reviewed.","CourseOffering":"","CoursePrerequisite":["2.50 credits in Psychology including PSYC*2360"],"CourseEquate":"","CourseRestriction":"PSYC*2040, STAT*2050.","CourseDepartment":"Department of Psychology","CourseLocation":"Guelph"},{"CourseCode":"PSYC*3300","CourseName":"Psychology of Gender","CourseSeasons":"Winter Only","CourseLectures":"(LEC: 3)","CourseWeight":"[0.50]","CourseDescription":"This course will examine the theories and psychological research that deals with the impact of gender upon people's lives and behaviour.
